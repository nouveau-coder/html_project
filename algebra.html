            <h3>Why Follow the Sequence?</h3>
            <p>Each topic in our curriculum is carefully designed to build upon the knowledge gained in the previous one. Starting with **Variables and Expressions** lays the groundwork for understanding how to manipulate terms, which is essential for solving **Equations**. Once you grasp equations, **Inequalities** introduce a new dimension to problem-solving, and finally, **Graphing Linear Equations** brings together algebraic concepts with visual representation. Following this progression ensures a solid understanding and smooth learning experience.</p>
